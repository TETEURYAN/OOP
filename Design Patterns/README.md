# Desing Patterns
In this repo tab we will cover design patterns

## Facade
Facade creates a simpler interface for interacting with a complicated subsystem that might have many interdependent classes or use legacy code. By providing a single point of entry, Facade reduces dependencies between the client code and the subsystem itself. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to test.

* Code example
´´´cpp
    class Subsystem1 {
 public:
  std::string Operation1() const {
    return "Subsystem1: Ready!\n";
  }
  // ...
  std::string OperationN() const {
    return "Subsystem1: Go!\n";
  }
};
/**
 * Some facades can work with multiple subsystems at the same time.
 */
class Subsystem2 {
 public:
  std::string Operation1() const {
    return "Subsystem2: Get ready!\n";
  }
  // ...
  std::string OperationZ() const {
    return "Subsystem2: Fire!\n";
  }
};

/**
 * The Facade class provides a simple interface to the complex logic of one or
 * several subsystems. The Facade delegates the client requests to the
 * appropriate objects within the subsystem. The Facade is also responsible for
 * managing their lifecycle. All of this shields the client from the undesired
 * complexity of the subsystem.

  Subsystem1 *subsystem1_;
